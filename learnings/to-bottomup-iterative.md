## Steps
- Figure out the bounds of the parameters
  - lowest and highest they can be
  - base cases and starting arguments 
- FIgure out what the order of the iteration is 
  - what does your parameters need to have computed before for your "recursion" to work
  - do you need smaller values first or big values first
    - if its small first, we simply iterate normally in a for loop with our bounds
    - otherwise, we go in reverse
- Side Note: Can't have negative values to index arrays
- Replace recursive calls with dp (table) values
  - in base cases, instead of returning, just store computed value in table and continue to next term
- To save space, identify constant dependencies 
  - aka there are constant changes such as i + 1
  - must be in outer loop
